A single player RPG in which you are the evil bad guy.

https://www.facebook.com/mirthlessrpg/

Mirthless is based on (heavily modified) code from EZDM and intends to create a full fledged single player role playing game with an ADND2E ruleset in which the player gets to play a truly evil character intent on becoming a dark lord.

The story outline is complete for the main quest, lots of side quests would be good.

*Contributors wanted:*

Right now more coders would be most valuable. Once the editor is complete we'll have lots of room for artists, writers, quest designers or other game-mod types.
If you're keen to contribute in any way please join the contributors mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mirthless-rpg--contributors

There is a lot of documentation to be written. I'll make an effort to expand the WIKI as things start approaching usable forms. Help would be greatly appreciated.

TODO's: see the GITHUB issues list.

I am going to try and get an initial playable alpha release up to the end of the opening chapter done by the end of December, more helpers will reduce that time. But the TODO list is quite long, even though the engine inheritted from EZDM is largely complete this involves quite a bit of work. So please be patient.

The built in make file can install the game:

`make install`

You can also build a debian/ubuntu/mint package instead:

`make deb`

If you prefer to track the installation.
To run the unit tests use:

`make test`
